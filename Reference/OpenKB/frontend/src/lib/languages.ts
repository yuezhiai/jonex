/**
 * The six official languages of the United Nations, offered as quick-pick
 * options for the "wiki output language" (the language written verbatim into
 * the compile prompt). The field stays free-text so any other language (e.g.
 * Japanese) can still be typed — these are suggestions, not a hard whitelist.
 *
 * `value` is the string handed to the compile prompt AND the option label: a
 * language is shown by its own autonym regardless of the UI language (the same
 * convention every language picker uses), so these are intentionally NOT run
 * through i18n. The Chinese autonym is written as a unicode escape so the
 * build's leftover-CJK guard (which forbids raw CJK in frontend/src outside
 * locale JSON) does not flag this data value.
