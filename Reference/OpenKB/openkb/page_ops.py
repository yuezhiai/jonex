"""Wiki-page mutations for the Workbench: delete a concept/entity page.

Reuses the compile/lint machinery so a deletion degrades cleanly rather than
leaving dangling references:

- inbound ``[[wikilinks]]`` in other pages are demoted to plain text
  (``lint.fix_broken_links``), not left pointing at a gone page;
- the page's ``index.md`` entry (itself a ``[[wikilink]]`` line) is removed
  outright (``compiler.remove_doc_from_index``).

All writes run under the KB ingest lock (crash-safe serial mutation, matching
``openkb remove``); the underlying rewrites use ``atomic_write_text``.
