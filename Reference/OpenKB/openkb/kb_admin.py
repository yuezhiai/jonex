"""Knowledge-base admin operations: physically delete a KB + registry cleanup.

Kept out of config.py (which sits near the per-file line gate) because these
mutate the filesystem (``shutil.rmtree`` under the KB ingest lock) and the
global registry — side effects the otherwise-pure config-loading module avoids.

Imports the config MODULE (not names) so ``config.GLOBAL_CONFIG_PATH`` is read
at call time — a test that monkeypatches it (isolated global.yaml) must be
honored, which a by-value ``from openkb.config import GLOBAL_CONFIG_PATH`` would
silently break.
