"""The skill-create agent.

Builds on the same openai-agents-SDK + LiteLLM stack as the query agent
in ``openkb.agent.query``. The differences:

* System prompt comes from ``openkb/prompts/skill_create.md`` and is
  interpolated with the user's intent and the target skill name.
* Tools are scoped: the same deep-retrieval primitives the query agent
  uses (``list``, ``read``, ``get_page_content``, ``get_image``), plus
  one write tool restricted to the target skill directory.
* The runner verifies that ``SKILL.md`` was written before declaring
  success — an agent that gets confused and never writes the required
  output should fail loudly rather than silently produce an empty dir.
