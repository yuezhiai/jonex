"""Thin CLI/Generator wrapper around any deck-producing skill.

The actual deck generation lives in skill packages — by default
``skills/openkb-deck-neon/SKILL.md``, but the caller may pass
``skill_name`` to route to a different one (e.g.
``deck-guizang-editorial`` from open-design). Skill execution runs
through :func:`openkb.agent.skill_runner.run_skill`, which also handles
output-path templating and post-run validation based on the skill's
``od:`` frontmatter.

This module exists only to:

* expose the deck CLI's ``critique`` flag as a second skill call
  (``openkb-html-critic``) chained after the producer skill,
* surface a clean ``Path``-returning interface for callers that don't
  care about skill plumbing.
