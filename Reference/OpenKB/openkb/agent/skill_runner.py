"""Generic skill runner — the shared core between CLI and chat surfaces.

A skill (Anthropic-style ``SKILL.md`` with YAML frontmatter and a body of
agent instructions) is loaded by ``run_skill``, which builds an Agent
whose ``instructions`` are that body. The agent gets the standard wiki
read-tool set plus a constrained ``write_file`` tool scoped to
``wiki/explorations/**`` and ``output/**``, and ``read_output_or_skill_file``
for inspecting prior artifacts.

This decouples generators from hard-coded prompts. ``openkb deck new`` /
``openkb skill new`` / any future ``openkb <type> new`` command becomes a
two-line wrapper around ``run_skill(skill_name=..., intent=...)``.

Skill frontmatter that ``run_skill`` honours (all optional; under the
top-level ``od:`` key):

* ``mode`` — the artifact type. ``"deck"`` triggers deck-specific
  post-run handling (output-path templating + validation). Unknown modes
  are accepted; they just don't trigger extra hooks.
* ``output_path_template`` — a path string with ``{slug}`` placeholder,
  relative to KB root. When set, ``run_skill`` injects the resolved path
  into the agent's intent and verifies the file exists post-run.
* ``deck_grammar`` — passed to :func:`openkb.deck.validator.validate_deck`
  when ``mode == "deck"``. See that module for the contract.

    When the skill's frontmatter declares ``od.mode == "deck"`` and
    ``od.output_path_template`` is set, ``run_skill``:

      1. Templates the path with the provided ``slug``.
      2. Adds a "Write to: <path>" line to the agent's intent so the
         skill knows the expected destination.
      3. After the agent run, checks the file exists and (if the skill
         declared ``od.deck_grammar``) runs ``validate_deck`` against it.

    Args:
        skill_name: Name (frontmatter ``name:``) of the skill to invoke.
        intent: Natural-language brief for what to produce.
        kb_dir: KB root. Used both for skill discovery and for the
            agent's wiki read-tools / write-file scoping.
        model: LiteLLM-formatted model string from KB config.
        language: Passed through to the underlying query agent for
            answer-language consistency.
        max_turns: Hard cap on agent loop iterations.
        seed: Optional kick-off user message. Defaults to a short nudge
            that points the agent at its own instructions.
        slug: Required when the skill declares
            ``od.output_path_template`` (it substitutes ``{slug}``).
            Otherwise ignored.
        extra_skill_roots: Additional directories to scan beyond the
            built-in ``<kb>/skills``, ``~/.openkb/skills``,
            ``~/.claude/skills``.
        bundle: Optional per-request LLM credential/config bundle. When

            concurrent requests never share process-global credentials.
            ``None`` (CLI default) preserves the existing behavior.
